# DAND_FBI_NICS_analysis

For this EDA project I have chosen to investigate the excerpted data from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) along with the supplemental Census population data by state. Federal law requires that Federal Firearm License (FFL) sellers to run background checks on prospective buyers through the NICS after it became operational in 1998. The NICS provides background check data for the purchase /transfer of both handguns and long guns (rifles) to eligible persons. Per Federal law, the FBI has 3 business days to allow or deny the transfer; after which the FFL seller may legally proceed with the transfer of the firearm(s).
